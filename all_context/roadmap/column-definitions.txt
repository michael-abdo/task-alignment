ROADMAP COLUMN DEFINITIONS
===========================
Framework: Feature → Components (Product Architect)

These definitions ensure:
- Every decision remains understandable one year later
- Every item exposes intent, boundaries, and ownership
- Every structure tolerates team growth, refactors, and partial rewrites

Context: "Required" means required for a complete roadmap row.
Initial generation may leave PM-populated fields empty (Owner, Hours, Status, Dates).


FEATURE-LEVEL COLUMNS (Parent)
------------------------------

Feature Name (Parent)
  What it captures: The human-readable label identifying a Feature that delivers user-visible value.
  Required: Yes
  Constraint: Must describe an outcome, never a pipeline or abstraction.
  Naming rule: Use invariant concepts; avoid technology-first or implementation-first names.
  Valid examples: "Interruption Detector", "Live Streaming UI"
  Invalid examples: "Redis Pipeline", "React Components"

Feature ID (Parent)
  What it captures: A unique, stable identifier for the Feature.
  Required: Yes
  Format: <DOMAIN>-F<##>
  Format note: Supports F01-F99. If >99 Features needed in a domain, use F100+ (3 digits).
  Valid examples: CORE-F01, PLAT-F05, PSYC-F02
  Constraint: Must survive renames; never reuse retired IDs.
  Retired ID tracking: Retired IDs tracked in Notes of last Component row: "Retired: YYYY-MM-DD".
  Last row defined: Last = highest Component # (e.g., C07 for Components C01-C07).

Feature Domain (Parent)
  What it captures: The categorical grouping indicating the Feature's area of concern.
  Required: Yes
  Allowed values (exhaustive):
    CORE - Core analytics and detection logic
    PLAT - Platform infrastructure, UI, and integrations
    PSYC - Psychometric instruments and assessments
    CTXT - Contextual adaptation and thresholds
    VALD - Validation, QA, and production readiness
    POST - Post-meeting synthesis and reporting
  Constraint: Every Feature must belong to exactly one domain.

Feature Owner(s)
  What it captures: The person(s) accountable for the Feature as a whole.
  Required: Yes
  Location: Dedicated column at Feature level.
  Constraint: Features may have multiple owners. Components may not.


COMPONENT-LEVEL COLUMNS
-----------------------

Component Name
  What it captures: The label for an atomic, independently buildable unit within a Feature.
  Required: Yes
  Constraint: Each Component owns exactly one responsibility.
  Replacement test: Removing or swapping this Component must not break sibling Components.
  Break defined: Causes compile error, runtime exception, or test failure in sibling Component.
  Reserved value: "COMPONENTS TO BE PROVIDED" signals a placeholder awaiting decomposition.
  Reserved value rule: Placeholders must have Status = "In Progress" until decomposed.
  Placeholder BLOCKER rule: Placeholders must have empty BLOCKER field. Dependencies on other Components apply after decomposition.
  Placeholder Success Criteria: "Decomposed into concrete Components with assigned Owners."
  Decomposition rule: Decomposition occurs when Owner replaces placeholder with concrete Component Names. Original row deleted; new rows inherit Feature ID.

Signals
  What it captures: The output event or data structure this Component produces.
  Required: Yes (empty permitted during Notes migration period)
  Format: <EventName>: <field1> + <field2> + <field3>
  Valid example: "InterruptionEvent: type + speakers + confidence"
  Constraint: Downstream consumers depend on this contract; changes require versioning.
  Versioning rule: Version tracked in Signals field as suffix: EventName_v2: field1 + field2. Breaking changes increment version.
  Version format: Initial version = EventName (no suffix). First breaking change = EventName_v2.
  Breaking change defined: Removing field, renaming field, or changing field type. Non-breaking = adding new field.
  Temporary rule: Signal data currently stored in Notes column until migration complete.

Owner
  What it captures: The single person or role accountable for this Component.
  Required: Yes
  Constraint: Exactly one owner per Component. "TBD" permitted as temporary placeholder.
  TBD rule: TBD must resolve before Status transitions to Done; verification cannot proceed with Owner = TBD. Maximum duration: 30 days from row creation.
  30 day enforcement: After 30 days, escalate to Feature Owner for resolution or documented exception.
  Documented exception format: Recorded in Notes: "TBD Exception: <reason> - Approved by <Feature Owner> on YYYY-MM-DD".
  Row creation date: Start Date for concrete Components. For placeholders with TBD owner, creation date tracked in Notes as "Created: YYYY-MM-DD".
  Note: Features may have multiple owners; Components may not.
  Valid examples: "Patrick", "Youssef", "Mike", "TBD"
  Invalid examples: "Patrick + Youssef", "Team", "Everyone"

Component Type
  What it captures: The technical layer classification of the Component.
  Required: Yes (empty for placeholders)
  Allowed values (exhaustive):
    BACK - Business logic and data processing
    FRONT - Frontend UI, visualization, user interaction
    INFRA - Deployment, hosting, external service connectors
    INTGR - Orchestration across multiple BACK/FRONT/INFRA components
  Constraint: Every Component must have exactly one type.
  Boundary clarification:
    - Database query service → BACK (business logic)
    - AWS deployment config → INFRA (hosting)
    - Hume API connector → INFRA (external service connector)
    - Pipeline coordinating BACK + INFRA → INTGR (orchestration)
  INFRA vs INTGR rule: INFRA = single external service connection. INTGR = coordinates 2+ Components or services into unified flow.

Component #
  What it captures: The sequence number of this Component within its parent Feature.
  Required: Yes (empty for placeholders)
  Format: C<##>
  Valid examples: C01, C02, C03
  Placeholder rule: Placeholders have Component # = empty. Component ID for placeholders = "<Feature ID> |" (no C## suffix).
  Constraint: Represents execution order within the Feature.
  Execution order defined: Recommended implementation sequence. C01 must complete before C02 begins.
  Execution vs Dependencies: Execution order applies to functional implementation. Design/scaffolding on C02 may proceed while C01 in progress if C01 listed in Dependencies (not BLOCKER).
  Gap rule: Gaps indicate deleted Components. No execution step skipped; remaining Components execute in sequence.

Component ID
  What it captures: The globally unique identifier combining Feature ID and Component number.
  Required: Yes
  Format: <Feature ID> | C<##>
  Valid examples: "PLAT-F01 | C01", "CORE-F05 | C02"
  Constraint: Must remain stable; never reuse after deletion.


DEPENDENCY COLUMNS
------------------

BLOCKER (component ID)
  What it captures: Component ID(s) that must reach "Done" before this Component can start.
  Required: Yes (empty permitted)
  Semantics: Hard blocker — no work of any kind can begin until blocker reaches "Done".
  Work defined: Includes planning, estimation, design, and implementation. All prohibited until BLOCKER resolves.
  Format: Single Component ID or comma-separated list.
  Empty value meaning: No hard blockers exist.
  Distinction from Dependencies: BLOCKER prevents all work; Dependencies allow parallel work.

Dependencies (Component IDs)
  What it captures: Component ID(s) whose outputs this Component consumes.
  Required: Yes (empty permitted)
  Semantics: Soft dependency — design and scaffolding may proceed in parallel; functional integration and testing require the dependency output.
  Design and scaffolding defined: Design = architecture docs, interface definitions, type signatures. Scaffolding = file structure, stub functions, test harnesses. Excludes: functional implementation, integration code.
  Format: Single Component ID or comma-separated list.
  Valid examples: "INFRA-S04-C02", "FRONTEND-S01-C01, INFRA-S03-C02"
  Empty value meaning: No dependencies exist.
  Distinction from BLOCKER: Dependencies allow parallel work; BLOCKER prevents all work.


PROJECT MANAGEMENT COLUMNS
--------------------------

  What it captures: A formatted string for import into Monday.com.
  Required: Yes
  Format: <Feature ID> / <Feature Name>
  Valid example: "CORE-F01 / Interruption Detector"

Success Criteria
  What it captures: The observable, testable outcome indicating Component completion.
  Required: Yes
  Framework: SMART goals - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound (where applicable).

  Format: <human-readable outcome> (<tracking metric>)

  Principles:
  - Abstract enough for non-technical users to validate
  - Metrics in parentheses provide tracking targets, not hard pass/fail thresholds
  - Metrics should be loose/achievable, not aspirational or cutting-edge
  - Focus on "right thing tracked" over "perfect number hit"

  Valid examples:
  - "UI feels responsive during playback (sub 200ms interaction delay)"
  - "Video plays smoothly without stuttering (≥24 FPS sustained)"
  - "Search results appear quickly (sub 500ms for typical queries)"
  - "User can complete upload without errors (≥95% success rate)"
  - "Dashboard loads without noticeable delay (sub 2s initial render)"

  Invalid examples:
  - "Works well" (no observable outcome, no metric)
  - "Video H.264 @30FPS" (technical spec, not user-testable outcome)
  - "Sub 50ms p99 latency" (metric-only, no human context)
  - "Fast enough" (subjective, no metric)
  - "REST endpoint returns 200" (implementation detail, not outcome)

Hours Est
  What it captures: The estimated effort in hours to complete this Component.
  Required: Yes

  Required: Yes
  Allowed values (exhaustive):
    Not Started - No work has begun
    In Progress - Active work underway
    Done - Success Criteria met and verified
  Constraint: "Done" requires Success Criteria verification; self-declaration insufficient.
  Verification rule: Verification requires (a) Owner confirms Success Criteria met, AND (b) one other team member confirms via any one of: code review, demo, or test run.
  Single-person team rule: If team has 1 person, verification requires documented self-review checklist OR external stakeholder sign-off.
  External stakeholder defined: Anyone outside the immediate development team: product manager, customer, QA lead, or engineer from another team.
  Self-review checklist: (a) Success Criteria met, (b) No regressions, (c) Documentation updated.

Start Date
  What it captures: The date when work on this Component began.
  Required: Yes (empty permitted for Status = Not Started)

  Population rule: Populated when Status transitions to In Progress.

End Date
  What it captures: The target completion date for this Component.
  Required: Yes (empty permitted for Status = Not Started without planning target)
  Format: YYYY-MM-DD
  Constraint: Represents a planning target, not a hard deadline.

Completion Date
  What it captures: The actual date when the Component achieved "Done" status.
  Required: Yes (empty permitted for Status ≠ Done)

  Invalid example: "See code"
  Temporary rule: Currently also stores Signal data until migration complete.

Risk Level
  What it captures: Assessment of replacement complexity and coupling exposure.
  Required: Yes
  Allowed values (exhaustive):
    Low - Minimal coupling; replacement requires < 1 day effort
    Medium - Moderate coupling; replacement requires 1-5 days effort
    High - Significant coupling; replacement requires > 5 days effort or architectural changes
  Measurement baseline: Days measured against median team member skill level. When uncertain, round up.
  Median defined: Mid-level engineer with 2-3 years experience on this codebase.
  New codebase rule: For codebases < 2 years old, median = engineer with experience on majority of existing codebase.


DEPENDENCY ID FORMAT REFERENCE
------------------------------
Two valid ID formats exist:

1. Component ID format: <Feature ID> | C<##>
   Used for: New Component identification
   Examples: "PLAT-F01 | C01", "CORE-F05 | C02"

2. Dependency ID format: <PREFIX>-S<##>-C<##>
